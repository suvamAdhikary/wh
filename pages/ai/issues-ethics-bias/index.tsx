            AI powered risk assessment systems used in courts that help predict
            the probability of a person reoffending and hence provide guidelines
            for sentencing or granting parole based on the calculated risk of
            recidivism. There is concern that these systems may be biased
            against people of color.

            Developers of AI systems can guard against introducing bias by
            providing effective training data and performing regular tests and
            audits to ensure the system is performing as expected.

            Concern among economists that developing countries are at even
            greater risk from AI encroaching into the job market with low-wage
            jobs quickly being lost.

            There are some ways that a developing country with many people
            looking for work can participate in the development of AI, and gain
            some benefits from the technology.
