            React builds a representation of the browser Document Object Model
            or DOM in memory called the virtual DOM. As components are updated,
            React checks to see if the componentâ€™s HTML code in the virtual DOM
            matches the browser DOM. If a change is required, the browser DOM is
            updated. If nothing has changed, then no update is performed.
